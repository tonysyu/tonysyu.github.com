<p>Normally when people talk about source control, they focus on collaboration: If
you're collaborating on code and you're not using source control, you're doing
it wrong! If you're collaborating with others, source control looks roughly
like this:</p>
<img alt="" src="http://tonysyu.github.io/images/posts/2014/git_collaborative_workspace.png" />
<p>If you're just working on your own code, though, you should still be
using source control. The soloist's workspace will look something like this:</p>
<img alt="" src="http://tonysyu.github.io/images/posts/2014/git_solo_workspace.png" />
<p>Whether or not you have a remote repository depends on how much you trust your
hard drive. If the above doesn't make sense, don't worry: These diagrams should
(I hope) become clear shortly.</p>
<p>Here I'll be focusing on git, since it's what I use for my day-to-day routine,
but any (distributed) version/source/revision control software will do. Some
commands will differ for other software, but the basic concepts are still the
same.</p>
<div class="section" id="motivation">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>This is a text version of a presentation I gave for my old lab group---back in
the day when I was in academia. If <em>anyone</em> needs to adopt source control, it's
scientific programmers: Scientists often develop code for themselves
(collaboration often focuses on the results, not the code), so we're prone to
think that source control is not relevant. The purpose of this article is to
convince you that source control is important---<em>even if you're the only one
looking at the code</em>.</p>
<p>Here's why you should be using source control:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>(Unless you have unit tests) There are often huge time gaps between breaking
code, and realizing that your code was broken. Source control remembers when
you don't.</li>
<li>You should document your rationale for changing code. (commit message)</li>
<li>It's key to reproducible research: You keep a lab notebook for a reason (your
memory sucks). Version control is your code notebook.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because this motivation part is so important, I put this into context with
real-world examples below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basic-concept">
<h2>Basic Concept</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Save code as logical sets of changes and write a good description of why you
changed it. (<tt class="docutils literal">git commit</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">git add</tt>)</li>
<li>Now you have a history of changes, that means you can:<ul>
<li>look back at your rationale (<tt class="docutils literal">git log</tt>)</li>
<li>change back if you need to (<tt class="docutils literal">git checkout</tt>)</li>
<li>find out where things went wrong (<tt class="docutils literal">git blame</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">git bisect</tt>)</li>
<li>remove code with the knowledge that you can easily go back</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-you-should-use-source-control">
<h2>Why you should use source control</h2>
<p>The purpose of this article is to convince you to use source control, so I want
to give concrete examples of how source control helps you. These examples are
taken from a Matlab code base that I adopted. In addition to my frustrations
with dealing with Matlab (&lt;3 Python), I had to navigate a code base that was
sorely lacking the benefits of source control, which is what prompted my
original presentation.</p>
<p>All examples are taken from real changes that I made to my adopted code base.
Apologies to the original authors of this code.</p>
<div class="section" id="you-re-already-trying-to-fake-it">
<h3>You're already trying to fake it!</h3>
<p>Here are some files from the code base I adopted.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://tonysyu.github.io/images/posts/2014/duplicates_directory.png" />
<p>You can see there are some newer versions of some files, but the author didn't
want get rid of the older files ... just in case. Or wait, are some parts of
the code still using the older versions? Sure, you can easily search (grep,
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/grin">grin</a>, ack, whatever), but don't make me
do extra work: I'm lazy.</p>
<p>Let's look closer at the two duplicates at the bottom: <tt class="docutils literal">id_paths.m</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">id_paths2.m</tt>. Here's is a <tt class="docutils literal">diff</tt> of those two files:</p>
<img alt="" src="http://tonysyu.github.io/images/posts/2014/id_paths_diff.png" />
<p>Note that these files were a few hundred lines each, but the <strong>only</strong>
difference between these two files are the lines highlighted in red. If there's
a newer version of something, just keep the newest version! Version control
will allow you to go back if really need to; otherwise, it's just
a distraction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-don-t-delete-enough-code">
<h3>You don't delete enough code!</h3>
<p>(or: &quot;Stop commenting out code and delete it already!&quot;)</p>
<p>Sometimes you add debugging code when you're developing your algorithms, but
the final product shouldn't have the code, so you do this:</p>
<img alt="" src="http://tonysyu.github.io/images/posts/2014/commented_out_code.png" />
<p>Notice the return statement in the middle of that code block. What you don't
see above is that there are a few hundred more lines of code that never get
run because of the early return statement. Keeping all that code around makes
it harder for you when you revisit the code. If you want to keep some debugging
code, save that separately so that you can easily focus on the important stuff.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-basic-commands">
<h2>The basic commands</h2>
<p>Git is notoriously complicated (and inconsistent). That said, if you stick to
some basic commands, you can get pretty far along.</p>
<div class="section" id="git-init-create-a-repository">
<h3><tt class="docutils literal">git init</tt>: Create a repository</h3>
<img alt="" src="http://tonysyu.github.io/images/posts/2014/git_init.png" />
<p>This is important to know, but it isn't that exciting. You just go into the
directory that contains all of your code (subdirectories will be included) and
run <tt class="docutils literal">git init</tt> to create the git repository (i.e. &quot;repo&quot;). This just needs to
be done once per project.</p>
<p>Just think of the repository as a place where the history is being stored.
A lot happens behind the scenes but who cares. (Maybe you care, but only after
you really know how to <em>use</em> it.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="git-add-and-git-commit-save-changes">
<h3><tt class="docutils literal">git add</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">git commit</tt>: Save changes</h3>
<p>The concept of <tt class="docutils literal">add</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">commit</tt> can be a bit confusing, especially if
you're coming from some other version control systems. Many other version
control systems just do what's equivalent to <tt class="docutils literal">git commit <span class="pre">--all</span></tt> (or <tt class="docutils literal">git
commit <span class="pre">-a</span></tt>).</p>
<img alt="" src="http://tonysyu.github.io/images/posts/2014/git_commit.png" />
<p>So let's assumed that we're just committing everything for now. This basically
saves all your changes... &quot;But wait, I've been saving my changes in my
editor/IDE; hell, it even auto-saves.&quot;</p>
<p>The power of committing your changes to git is that you save the history. This
concept is much more powerful than something like <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(Mac_OS)">Time Machine</a>. You had
a reason for changing your code; you should document it (e.g., &quot;Fix for when
the signal is all zeros&quot;, &quot;Update code to &lt;this paper that improves on the
original algorithm&gt;&quot;). Sure you could add a code comment to (poorly) document
a few lines that changed, but what if those changes spanned multiple parts of
the code. Your commit (and <em>descriptive</em> commit message) groups those logical
changes together.</p>
<p><em>After</em> you get into the habit of committing your changes using
<tt class="docutils literal">git commit <span class="pre">--all</span></tt>, you'll want to evolve towards explicitly calling
<tt class="docutils literal">git add</tt> to specify which files you want to add to a specific commit. This
helps you group your changes better and helps you write a better, more
<em>descriptive</em> commit message.</p>
<div class="section" id="git-add-organize-your-save">
<h4><tt class="docutils literal">git add</tt>: Organize your save</h4>
<p>We're not always great at concentrating on a single change. Explicitly
specifying the files you want to add to the commit will force you to be more
organized about the changes you made.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://tonysyu.github.io/images/posts/2014/git_add.png" />
<p><tt class="docutils literal">git add</tt> puts your changes into what's called the &quot;staging area&quot;, and then
then you call <tt class="docutils literal">git commit</tt> to commit everything from the staging area.</p>
<p>More advanced: If you've made changes that aren't really part of the same
fix/feature/whatever, you can add specific lines, but that's for another post.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="git-log-your-code-history">
<h3><tt class="docutils literal">git log</tt>: Your code history</h3>
<p>The log is your code notebook. You have a history of all the commits you have
made. Most scientists want a history of the calculations they've done with all
the missteps and epiphanies documented. Sometimes you just don't remember why
you did something. This is a quick way to look back in time when your memory
fails you.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://tonysyu.github.io/images/posts/2014/git_log.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="git-diff-what-did-i-do">
<h3><tt class="docutils literal">git diff</tt>: What did I do?</h3>
<p>(or: &quot;Finally! this works. Wait. What actually fixed the problem?&quot;)</p>
<p>You've made a ton of changes to fix some bug or add some feature. Inevitably,
you've made some changes that weren't really part of the feature (e.g. print
statements for debugging). <tt class="docutils literal">git diff</tt> allows you to check what has changed
from the original implementation.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://tonysyu.github.io/images/posts/2014/git_diff.png" />
<p>More advanced: If you're using the staging area properly, you call
<tt class="docutils literal">git diff <span class="pre">--staged</span></tt> to make sure that all the code you've added really
pertains to the (very descriptive) commit message you're going to write.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="git-checkout-revisit-old-code">
<h3><tt class="docutils literal">git checkout</tt>: Revisit old code</h3>
<p>(or: &quot;Argh, I wish I hadn’t made these changes!&quot;)</p>
<p>&quot;I know my function didn't behave this way before,... wait am I sure about
that?&quot; Well, you can always go back to old code by checking out an older
version.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://tonysyu.github.io/images/posts/2014/git_checkout.png" />
<p>Now you can try it out to see if this random dataset <em>actually</em> worked with
the old code and figure out what changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="git-blame-when-and-why-was-this-line-added">
<h3><tt class="docutils literal">git blame</tt>: When and why was this line added?</h3>
<p>We've all looked at some part of our code and forgotten why we added needed it.
<tt class="docutils literal">git blame</tt> allows you to look each line of a file and figure out when it was
added, and your commit message tells you why you added it.</p>
<img alt="" src="http://tonysyu.github.io/images/posts/2014/git_blame.png" />
<p>Note that this only works well if your commit messages are informative.
Otherwise, you still don't know why you wrote that perplexing line of code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="summary">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Stop trying to invent your own version control
(i.e. don't write file that look like: <tt class="docutils literal">my_script.py</tt>/<tt class="docutils literal">my_script_2.py</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">solver.py</tt>/<tt class="docutils literal">solver_old.py</tt>)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Reproducibility and history are very important (especially for scientists)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The basic usage of git is pretty simple. (If you're not comfortable on the
command-line though, there are tools to help you out---see below.)</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Good commit messages are important</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Bad:   &quot;update code&quot;</li>
<li>Good:  &quot;Add calculate_standard_error function&quot;, &quot;Fix for NaN inputs&quot;</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This describes git usage from the perspective of someone who's comfortable
using the command line. Since programming isn't the focus of many scientists,
you may not be as comfortable on the command line. Fear not: There are many
GUI clients for git. I can't really throw my weight behind any of them since
I don't use any of them, but <a class="reference external" href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/sourcetree/overview">SourceTree</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.syntevo.com/smartgithg/">SmartGit</a> both look pretty
popular.</p>
<p>In the end, I don't think I was successful in converting any of my fellow
scientists to use source control. The problem is that it takes a bit of
discipline at the very beginning, and, like many things in life, it's hard to
see the benefits until you've already invested a bit of time to learn it.</p>
<p>Now that my day job is software development, I don't need to convince anyone
of the benefits of source control. But maybe there's a scientist out there who
does need some convincing ...</p>
