<h4>Fog capture</h4>
<p>Fog capture is desirable as a water resource in remote areas that receive
a large amount of fog, such as the Namib desert and the mountains of Peru. In
addition, fog removal is attractive around roadways and airports to to improve
visibility and reduce traffic accidents &amp; delays.</p>
<p>For this project, I constructed a wind tunnel for imaging flows with
micron-sized droplets suspended in air (i.e. fog). In order to characterize the
flow and measure the accumulation of water on substrates, I implemented
particle-tracking and circle-finding algorithms.</p>

<h4>Simulations of organic-crystal-needle formation via solvent-vapor annealing</h4>
<p>Organic semiconductors are attractive materials for creating flexible,
light-weight, and transparent electronic at low costs. In addition, single
crystals of the semiconductor increases charge-carrier mobility and can promote
nonlinear optical phenomena.</p>
<p>For my Ph.D., I constructed an experiment to measure the growth rates of
single-crystal needles of tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum---i.e. Alq, an
organic semiconductor commonly used in organic LEDs---during annealing in
methanol-vapor. I modeled this system as a thin, liquid film composed of
a mixture of Alq &amp; methanol and driven by intermolecular forces,
surface-tension, &amp; diffusion. Simulations based on this model compared
favorably with experimental measurements.</p>

<h4>Static shapes and instability of flags conveying fluid</h4>
<p>We investigate a simple experiment, where a long, thin sheet, <em>i.e.</em> &quot;flag&quot;
(black in image) is clamped to a jet-nozzle (green in image). The jet wets and
flows along one side of the flag from base (clamped end) to tip, which hangs
freely. At low flow rates numbers, we observed stable, static flag shapes with
wavelengths inversely proportional to the flow rate. The static shapes are well
described by a simple model (blue in image) coupling linear beam bending and
inviscid flow. At higher flow rates, static shapes become unstable, leading to
periodic oscillations analogous to previous work on hanging cantilever tubes
conveying fluid (Paidoussis, 1970; Doare and Langre, 2002). The observed
critical flow rates for instability agree well with those predicted by linear
stability analysis.</p>

<h4>Transition from drag to thrust in a flapping foil</h4>
<p>Most objects in fast-moving flow shed vortices of alternating sign, this is
known as a Bernard-von Karmann <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_vortex_street">vortex street</a>. For flapping objects (e.g.
wings or fish tails) that generate thrust, we observe a similar wake, but with
opposite rotation. I built a <a class="reference external" href="http://maartenrutgers.org/science/soapbasics/soapbasics.html">soap film tunnel</a> and attempted to visualize the
transition between these two cases; unfortunately, my experimental setup didn't
allow me to observe the later phenomenon. Here's my <a class="reference external" href="../static/includes/SoapFilm.pdf">final presentation</a> from
the class, but it's pretty incomprehensible because it's just a series of
pictures with almost no text.</p>
<p>Note: At the 2008 APS DFD meeting, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.schnips.dk/prof/">Teis Schnipper</a> presented a similar experiment with amazing results.</p>
